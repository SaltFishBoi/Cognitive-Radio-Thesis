\section{Future Work}
Take note that the current testbed contains limitations. It accommodates basic regulation of an operating radio device, however, a set of much detailed and rigorous rules must be integrated into the system for commercial or military uses. The testbed is built around the CR algorithm proposals under the field of reactive channel selection. Area such as proactive channel selection requires another platform to keep all the spectrum data for regional networks to access. This requires a setup of a designated, centralized data division to process spectrum history. With a proactive channel selection system, the focus will be minimizing the channel switching delay of the hardware. Speaking of sharing knowledge from a region to another, simply adding more BSs can accomplish some of that. This takes it to the next level of cognitive radio network, which allows any sequential CR project launch to adopt the system very easily. Another aspect of the study, geo-barrier during employment, is also very important. Each device would not only be capable of recognizing other devices, they must also need to analyze the signal strength and advise the user for a better location. That is where city planning or location management comes into place. Looking back to the hardware, in fact, all should take this thesis project as purely a model of the system. The end goal for this system is to fully integrate onto a printed circuit board. These could be continually worked on and refined in the near future. 

\section{Summary}
In conclusion, this project integrates selective standards and guidelines that are given to form a CRN into a scalable testbed for future studies. The information gathered is initially around CR technology itself. To establish a network, it involves some basic protocol and radio frequency knowledge. Making a physical testbed, it is necessary to go through the whole hardware development and verification process. The experiments run in the testbed results in emulated data, which reflects the performance of certain CR logic. 

Now, with the understanding of where the CRN will be directed, all should stay tuned to this technology. Soon it may be implemented in our local network before you know it.
