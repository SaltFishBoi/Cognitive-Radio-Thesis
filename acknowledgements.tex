\noindent
First, I would like to give thanks to my parents who supported me through this tough time this past year. They work so hard in exchange for my accomplishments in school. Their love and care toward me is invaluable and ineffable.

Next, I want to show my most gratitude to all my committees. Professor Smilkstein inspired and guided me through every detail of the thesis. Over the course, I give credit to her who instructed and advised with insights on related topics. I appreciated the intentionality from Professor Smith. It was him who taught Network with passion, which motivated me to take a step further with this project. Special thanks to Dr. Peters in the College of Liberal Art. I am grateful to have him, being a non-technical audience, advising me on the thesis report. Each of my committees assist me in ways that are most helpful. Thank you. 

Lastly, I also would like to thank all the tutors who helped me at the Cal Poly "Writing and Learning Initiatives" program. And, I give thanks to my roommate Charlie who helped me solder all the components in a timely manner.
